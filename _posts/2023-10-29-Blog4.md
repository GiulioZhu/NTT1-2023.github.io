### (W/C Monday 29th October): Meeting with Industry Mentor ###

On November 1st, we met with our IXN industry mentor, Tom Winstanley, as planned. This meeting was crucial in refining our focus and understanding of the project. We also established regular weekly mentorship sessions(as needed) with a representative from NTT Data, ensuring consistent guidance as we move forward.

The meeting notes are as follows:

The insights from this session were vital in shaping our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) presentation and the first draft of our prototype on Figma.

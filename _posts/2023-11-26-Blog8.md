### (W/C 26th November): Installing and setting up Android Studio, Vuforia and ARCore ###

This week we started setting up Android Studio, Vuforia, and ARcore on our respective devices as well as trying out the samples given by them. We were able to successfully run a sample on our phone which allowed us to detect objects on the app.

Also, we have come to an issue that Vuforia may be out of date. We set up a meeting with Gadhu for next week to further discuss the requirements as well as get a timeline and a detailed Gantt chart running for this project.

We also raised a ticket with requestUCL to get access to a router we could use for testing for our App.

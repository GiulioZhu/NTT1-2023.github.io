### (W/C Monday 15th October ): Constructing a set of questions and a skeleton PowerPoint ###

In preparation for our HCI presentation, we decided to start working on a skeleton of our PowerPoint, to include broad subjects such as what we thought the personas may look like based on the requirements listed above.

Here is an example persona we made during this time.

Furthermore, we started writing down potential questions to discuss with our IXN mentor in preparation for our meeting next week.

The breadth of the requirements led us to formulate several key questions to guide our project.

### (W/C Monday 8th October ): Receiving the Project Requirements and group members ###

Our adventure commenced in the second week of October with the reception of our project requirements as well as our assigned group members.

Group Members:

Ayman Khan, Giulio Zhu, and Ahmed Ansari

1. **Augmented Reality (AR) Guidance**: To offer AR support to field engineers or customers for setting up or resetting hardware, with a focus on recognizing the device and its state to provide tailored field assistance.
2. **Automated Data Capture and Predictive Maintenance**: To develop a system for automated data recording of field assets and equipment, with integrated validations to enable predictive maintenance recommendations.

With this information, we created a WhatsApp group to ease communication and set up a meeting to discuss what to do next with our requirements. During the meeting, we created an email to send to our IXN mentor to set up a meeting with him to further break down our requirements. As our mentor was quite busy and out of the country at the time, the earliest we could set up a meeting with him was the 1st of November.

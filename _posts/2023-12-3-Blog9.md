### (W/C  3rd December): Finalizing requirements and timeline ###

This week we started to break the tasks further to be able to split the project evenly among us so that we could start to work in parallel. Furthermore, we completed an estimate on the amount of time that each task should approximately take, so that we can start to get a general idea of a timeline. Our meeting with Gadhu to discuss the use of Vuforia is on the 8th of December.

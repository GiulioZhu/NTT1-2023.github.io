### (W/C 19th November): Technical Mentoring Session ###

The sixth week, mid-November, marked a turning point. We engaged in a detailed discussion with Gadhu Sundaram, delegated by Tom Winstanley, to guide us through the technical side of the project. During this meeting, we made crucial decisions about our software and platform:

- **Platform Decision**: We resolved to develop an Android application.
- **Technology Stack**: We chose to use Vuforia for image detection and ARCore, Google's toolkit for AR development.
- **Static Website Development**: We decided to use Jekyll, a static website generator, for transforming various markup languages into a static website.

This meeting was instrumental in defining our technological approach and setting the foundation for the next steps in our project.
